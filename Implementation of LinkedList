Linked list:

Linked list can store the elements dynamically when compared with arrays.
They don't need to be stored in a contigious memory. It can be stored in various parts of memory

Disadvantages:
Linked list have linear look up time. They are low level data structures in python and are rarely used.

Implementation of LinkedList:


class Node:
  def __init__(self, val):
    self.val= val
    self.next=None
    
  node1 = Node(12)
  node2=Node(99)
  node3=Node(121)
  
  node1.next= node2
  node2.next = node3
  
  
  That's it that is the implementation of a Linked List
  
  
 Double Linked List:
 
 In double linked list we have
 
 class Node:
    def __init__(self,val):
      self.val=val
      self.next=None
      self.prev=None
      
    node1 = Node(12)
    node2 = Node(13)
    node3 = Node(15)
    
    
    node1.prev=None
    node1.next=node2
    node2.next = node3
    node2.prev=node1
  

#Traversing a linked list:
class Node 
 ...
 
 def traverse(self):
  node=self
  while Node!=None:
    print node.val
    node1=node2.next
